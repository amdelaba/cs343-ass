• Explain the relative differences in the timing results with respect to static versus dynamic multi-level
exit within a routine.
- The difference between running the program with static versus dynamic multi-level exit is significant.
As shown above, the execution is much faster with static multi-level exit. This is due to the fact that 
the handler/exit is statically known at compile time.

//**
Static multi-level exit exits multiple control structures where exit points are known at compile
time.The advantage of the sequel is the handler is statically known (like static multi-level exit),
and can be as efficient as a direct transfer.

Dynamic propagation is also called dynamic multi-level exit. The advantage is that dynamic propagation works for separately-compiled programs.
The disadvantage (advantage) of dynamic propagation is the handler is not statically known. 
Without dynamic handler selection, the same action and context for that action is executed
for every exceptional change in control flow.

• State the performance difference when compiler optimization is used?
- With static multi-level exit the difference between running the program using optimization is noticeable and significant. 
The optimization cuts the execution time by half. This is due to the fact that the exits points are known at compile time and the compiled code can be indeed optimized. 

With dynamic multi-level exit, the execution is not only not optimized but it is slowed down, although the difference is so
miniscule is almost irrelevant. Exit points are known at run time therefore compiler optimization can't make this code run any faster.




• BONUS: If there is a difference in performance using -O2, explain what compiler optimization is
being performed to achieve the performance gain.

(B) Determine the cost of propagation and stack unwinding.
                                                                                                    
• Compile with EXCEPT defined and the compiler optimization turned on, and then run the program
varying the number of recursive calls to rtn to increase the stack depth before the exception is raised.

• Explain the relative differences in the timing results with respect to propagation among routines.
Include a number of timing results to validate your explanation.
- The execution time is directly proportional to the number of times the routine rtn is recursively 
called. This is due to the fact that the stack is unwound frame by frame at a constant time rate.





(C) Explain when dynamic multi-level exit is necessary and unnecessary.
